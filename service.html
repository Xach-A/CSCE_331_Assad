      <p>As an Aggie, I try to actively give back to my community through food drives, volunteering,
        and mentoring. Through local organizations and my faith-based community, we hand-make and 
        deliver hundreds of food bags for the less fortunate in Houston. <br><br>
        As an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant on campus, I have the privilege of leading my lab session
        and helping out fellow students by explaining programming concepts and sharing my experience
        with them.
      </p>

      <p>I believe that one of the greatest rewards comes through helping others in need and making
        a positive impact in their lives.
