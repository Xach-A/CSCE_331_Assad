      <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <img src="images/me_prof.jpg" alt="Me">
      <p>Howdy! I'm Zach Assad, a junior Computer Engineering student at
        Texas A&M University. Computers and technology have always been an integral part of my life
        and wanting to know how they worked and interacted with each other led me to pursue this field.
        I am especially interested in the interaction between software and hardware. <br><br>
        Over the past few years, I've developed a strong foundation in the software side of computers, including
        programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, ArmV8, and JavaScript, as well as markup
        languages such as HTML and CSS, all of which I have applied in my projects. I've deepened my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and
        operating systems, while also developing the necessary skills to work within engineering teams. I'm grateful to have
        the opportunity to lead and share my knowledge with aspiring computer scientist students as an undergraduate
        TA. <br><br>
        I've also greatly expanded my skills on the hardware side. I've gained invaluable experience
        in breadboarding, circuit construction and analysis, digital logic design, and computer architecture.
        I've learned how to describe hardware using Verilog and work with FPGA-based development tools.
        I've even developed a passion for ASICs and FPGAs and would love to work with them
        in my future job. <br><br>
        I've worked with many teams through academia and internships to collaborate to accomplish a goal,
        develop my soft skills, and gain experience in the workforce. I volunteer through organizations and my faith-based
        community to help those in need. <br><br>
        In the future, I aspire to work in the hardware industry, perhaps as an ASIC/FPGA engineer, where I can apply
        the knowledge and skills I have learned to research, design, and develop cutting-edge technology.
        I'm very passionate about this field and excited to see what opportunities I will have ahead of me.</p>
