    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming Languages: C++, Java, Python, Armv8</li>
      <li>Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
      <li>Tools and Tech: GitHub/Git, Linux, Visual Studio Code</li>
      <li>Hardware: Verilog, Xilinx Vivado, FPGA, Breadboarding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I have taken and succeeded in numerous programming courses, and I am currently a TA for Intro to C++.
      I understand the fundamentals, as well as concepts relating to data structures, algorithms, and
      operating systems. 
    </p>
    <p>Designing my personal website has deepened my knowledge in web development and granted me the skills
      and experience necessary to create more. </p>
    <p>I've tackled numerous projects using Git as my version control system, and VS code for editing
      my code. I've also worked extensively in linux systems, and I am more than familiar with its commands.
    </p>

    <p>I have knowledge in Verilog for describing hardware and hands-on experience in FPGA 
      design and simulation using Xilinx Vivado.</p>

    <h4>Technical Areas of Interest</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Embedded Systems</li>
      <li>ASICs/FPGAs</li>
      <li>Robotics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Embedded Systems are fascinating to me. I would love to not only design the software,
      but to design the hardware as well to create highly specialized and advanced systems.  </p>
      <p>Ever since I took my digital logic design course, I have fallen in love with FPGAs.
        It's amazing how versatile and customizable they can be. Working closely with ASICs and/or FPGAs
      is a dream of mine. </p>
    
    <P>Robotics is a field that has always excited me since I was a kid.
      The combination of mechatronics and software to create smart automated systems 
      is mind-blowing, and I would not pass up on the opportunity to learn more about it.
    </P>
